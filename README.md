# Course Graphical interface for Python Apps with GTK and Glade

### Course Description
Graphical interface, also commonly abbreviated as GUI (Graphical User Interface) is the user interface model that allows interaction with digital devices through graphic elements, being able to select and manipulate icons and symbols in order to perform tasks with such devices. A graphical environment is a program created to make using the computer easier through visual representations of the operating system. Linux, for example, has several graphical environments; among which we can highlight the Gnome, which is built using the GTK (GIMP Toolkit). In turn, GTK is the toolkit originally developed for GIMP (a program for creating and editing images) and written in C, and can also be used to build applications for Windows and macOS.

Developers using the Python programming language often find it very difficult to create graphical interfaces for their applications. This is due to the fact that although there are several toolkits, they usually come with negative points that end up slowing down the work. 

The aim of the course is to be quick and practical so that you can solve your problems as quickly as possible. The graphical interfaces will be built using GTK + 3, which is used in a large number of applications and in the Linux Gnome desktop environment. To speed up development, we will also address Glade, which is a builder of GTK's RAD (Rapid Application Development) graphical interfaces. GTK is free, rich in graphic components, has great documentation and because it is written in C, its performance is excellent and does not present problems of incompatibility with Python. In addition, GTK is multiplatform; that is, the applications work on Windows, Linus and MacOS. We will also use GtkBuilder, which allows use in several other programming languages, such as: C, C ++, C #, Vala, Java, Perl, Python and others.

### What I have learned in the course:
- Develop graphical interfaces for Python desktop applications using Gtk +
- Use the Glade GUI builder for agile development
- Package the application for distribution on other computers
- Manipulate Gtk3 GUI objects created by Glade
- Step by step create a calculator with all the basic arithmetic operations
- Develop step by step the main menu, registration window and list of records in memory  

### Requirements
- Programming logic, mainly conditional structures 
- Basic Python Programming
- Basic knowledge of Object Orientation
